The "Bike Bliss Rentals" project successfully implements a predictive system to forecast hourly bike rental demand using a linear regression model. Here’s how the system was structured and implemented:

Data Handling and Preparation:
Comprehensive data loading and preprocessing stages ensured a clean and useful dataset. The training and testing datasets were loaded from CSV files, and necessary data cleaning and transformation processes, including normalization and handling of missing values, were executed.
Feature Engineering:
Significant features affecting bike rental demand, such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, and temporal elements like hour and day of the week, were carefully extracted and utilized. This step was critical in refining the model’s ability to recognize and learn demand patterns.
Model Development and Training:
A linear regression model was chosen and implemented using scikit-learn, optimized for the specific characteristics of the data. The model was trained on the selected features, fine-tuned to ensure accuracy, and validated against a testing set to evaluate its predictive performance.
Data Visualization and Analysis:
Tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed to visualize data correlations and trends, helping in both the exploratory data analysis phase and in presenting the model outcomes effectively.
Deployment via Streamlit:
The model was integrated into a user-friendly web application developed using Streamlit, enabling real-time predictions and interaction with end-users who can input specific conditions to receive bike rental demand forecasts.
